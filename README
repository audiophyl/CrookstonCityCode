Style/Formatting Notes.

I am quite aware that the document, at present, does not adhere to an entirely consistent style. Below are the stylistic decisions I've made up to this point.

Chapter files will begin:
\chapter*{Chapter #: \\
	Chapter Title}
    \addstarredchapter{Chapter #: Chapter Title}
    \minitoc
    \emph{\textbf{Cross-Reference:}\\
        Cross references here}
    \pagebreak

'Sub-chapters' will be presented as:
\begin{center}
    \emph{\textbf{\LARGE{SUB-CHAPTER TITLE\\[.1cm] STRAY SECOND LINE}}}
\end{center}

Lists preceded by an introduction ending in a colon (":") will be enumerated (with the form "1)", "A)" or "a)"):
\begin{enumerate}[{\indent}1)]
    \item
    ...
\end{enumerate}

Lists not preceded by an introduction ending in a colon will be treated as subsections/subsubsections/paragraphs/subparagraphs.

Smart quotes will be used in favor of double quotes.

CAPITALIZED WORDS contained within a block of text will be \emph'd, but not \textbf'd.

Setting: Sitting at home, enjoying a pleasant Saturday evening. A thought strikes, and pbarton cannot help but to remotely connect and put bits to disk.

Quick technical details:

The distribution used for compiling the LaTeX source in this folder was TeXLive. On Ubuntu 12.04, installing this is a simple matter:

`sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra`

Aaaaaaand you're done.

So, you're wondering "Why LaTeX?" and thinking I'm a bit of a boffin for doing things this way. I'd like to detail for you exactly why this is the case.

Reasons:

1. The City Code is a highly complex document with formatting that a word processor cannot understand (or at least, 'cannot easily understand').

2. Even if #1 were not an issue, you would be locked in to a word processor, and probably a (very expensive) commercial one at that.

3. LaTeX is open source, inherently free, and the file format (plain text) runs no risk of obselescence.
   a. Just try opening a Word '97 file in Word 2013 (or whatever the children are using these days) and see how well it goes for you.
   b. A LaTeX file renders the same today as it did 30 years ago: consistenly and beautifully

4. LaTeX is typesetting software, not a word processor.
   a. The City Code is an IMPORTANT document which should look professional, legal, and IMPORTANT.
      1. Word doesn't look 'professional' or 'important', it looks like an inter-office memo.
      2. Acrobat? You can get there, but it's even more expensive than Office and gets you no further toward the all-important goal of 'abstraction'.
   b. The City Code is an important document which should invite readers to jump in.
      1. Reminder: it's typesetting software, not a word processor.
      2. LaTeX can do the heavy lifting for you (see next)

5. Automatic content generation:
   a. Table of Contents? Automatic (and ALWAYS CORRECT)
   b. Individual Title Tables of Content? Automatic (and ALWAYS CORRECT)
   c. Indices? Automatic (and ALWAYS CORRECT)
   d. Cross-references? Automatic (and ALWAYS CORRECT)

6. Abstraction.
   a. Formatting and content are two separate things. Word processors treat them as one and the same thing, LaTeX does not.
   b. Editors need not worry about formatting, only content. This is good, as most people who touch a 'living document' in a word processor tend to screw it up somehow.
   c. Speaking of screwing things up, lists and tables are prime candidates. They're near-impossible to screw up once they've been abstracted away from their formatting.

6. It's no more difficult to learn how to manage a document in LaTeX than it is to learn how to manage the same document in a word processor.
   a. It's arguably a more shallow learning curve. Every word processor is different, but all you'll need with LaTeX is a (free) 'TeX' distribution (Linux, OSX, Windows - it doesn't matter) to handle the rendering. Most will already include the extensions I have used, and the ones which don't will provide informative errors that quick Google searches will help you resolve.
   b. It's DEFINITELY a more shallow learning curve than Acrobat.

7. Your output isn't limited to a specific file format.
   a. At the time of writing, the City Code is output to two formats simultaneously:
      1. PDF, and a smaller one than Acrobat was able to render given the old Word .doc files.
      2. HTML/CSS - and not just a single monolithic page. It's logically broken into Titles, Chapter, Sections, Sub-Sections, Sub-Sub-Sections... you get the idea. MS Word CANNOT DO THIS.
   b. Oh yeah, you can output to Word .doc(x) or RTF, among other useless formats. Just Google it.

8. Since LaTeX is proper typesetting software, a document which is not strongly structured is revealed for what it is. This is a good thing, as it reveals stylistic inconsistency in the City Code and encourages fixing.

9. The final output is very literally fit for print - as a book, which the City Code IS. Nobody writes books with Word, for the reasons I have already detailed.

In closing, I know you will do whatever you want. Just don't tell me if you decide to switch to a 'powerful word processor'. 'Those people' are short-sighted and value busy work over accomplishment.

THAT'S why it's LaTeX.
