\section{Abatement}
\subsection{Enforcement}
Sections of this chapter enforced by the Police Department shall be enforced through citation, summons, complaint, or arrest, to the appropriate county or district court.
\subsection{Notice}
For all violations of this chapter enforced by city officers other than the Police Department, written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as set forth in this section.
\subsubsection{Notice of Violation}
Written notice of violation shall be served by a city officer on the owner of record or occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.  If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served by posting it on the premises.
\subsubsection{Notice of City Council Hearing}
Written notice of any City Council hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.

The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated.  If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the officer shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council.  Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and notice of motion for summary enforcement.
\subsection{Emergency Procedure; Summary Enforcement}
In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements set forth in divisions (B) and (C) of this section will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.  To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare.  The officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement.  The City Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (B) of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated.  If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
\subsection{Immediate Abatement}
Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.\\
\emph{Penalty, see SEC. 10.99}

Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the Clerk-Treasurer.
\subsection{Assessment}
If the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the Clerk-Treasurer shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other the charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. \textsection 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable.

\section{Weeds and Grass}
\subsection{}
On or before June 1 of each year, after the effective date of this subdivision and at such other times as ordered by resolution of the City Council, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall publish once in the official newspaper a notice directing owners and occupants of property within the City to cut and remove all weeds, whether noxious or not, and all grass outside the traveled portion of any street or alley adjacent to the property having attained a height of eight (8) inches and stating that if not so cut and removed, the City may do so at the expense of the owner and occupant and, if not paid, the charge for such work may be made a special assessment against the property concerned. Failure of the City Clerk-Treasurer to properly publish the general notice does not relieve a person from the necessity of full compliance with Chapter 94 Section 94.01 and related provisions. The City shall also mail notice to affected property owners to cut and remove all weeds, whether noxious or not, and cut all grass, on private property and on non-traveled portions of any abutting street or alley, having attained a height of eight (8) inches, within three (3) days after such notice.  If weeds are not so cut and removed, or if grass is not so cut, the City may do so and keep a record of the cost attributable to each property. See Section 94.01(D).
\subsection{}
This Subdivision shall not apply to: “Natural areas” which shall be defined as densely wooded areas, bogs and marshes, as well as undisturbed lands, an area where the land and vegetation appear not to have been graded, landscaped, mowed or otherwise disturbed by human or mechanical means at any time. The weed inspector or assignee shall use reasonable judgment in determining what constitutes this type of area based on the present appearance of the area and research as to the history of the area, if such information is available. “Natural areas” may also be created as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[{\indent}1)]
    \item Those individuals who wish to naturalize portions of their property must submit a Landscaping Management Plan for approval.  Such Plan will require a review before the Parks and Recreation Department, which will make recommendations to approve or disapprove the Plan to the City Council.  The Landscaping Management Plan will require a public hearing.
    \item In the event that a notice of a possible violation of this Subdivision has been sent, and the individual wishes to submit a request to naturalize the area that is designated in the notice, the individual may, within the required time frame for correction of the violation, submit a Landscaping Management Plan.  The City will take no enforcement action until a final determination has been made on the Plan.
    \item Landscaping Management Plan means a written plan relating to the management of the natural area, which contains a plot plan of the area upon which grass and other growth will exceed eight (8) inches in height or length, a statement of intent and purpose for the area, a general description of the vegetation types, plant succession involved and specific management techniques to be employed.
    \item Notwithstanding the fact that approval has been given for a Landscaping Management Plan, the Fire Chief may order the cutting of such natural area at any time when in the exercise of his/her official duties, he/she determines that the growth has become so hazardous as to cause a danger to the safety of the inhabitants of any residential structure on said property or to the citizens and residents of the neighborhood in which the Landscaping Management Plan has been approved.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{}
Transmission line or utility easements.
\subsection{}
Park land.
\subsection{}
Storm water/sanitary ponds.

\subsection{}
Non-noxious weeds and grass and herbaceous vegetation within fifty (50) feet of natural or altered creeks, rivers and stream corridors, including riparian buffer strips that convey water.\\
Notwithstanding any provision of this Subdivision to the contrary, noxious weeds and other vegetation must be eliminated or cut as otherwise required by law or regulation.\\
