\newline\indent(a) A reasonable rate shall be construed to be one which will, with efficient management, normally yield above all operating expenses and depreciation, a fair return upon all money invested.
\newline\indent(b) If possible, maximum rates and charges shall be arrived at by direct negotiation with the Council.
\newline\indent(c) If direct negotiations fail to produce agreement, the Council shall, not less than 30 days before the expiration of any existing rate schedule or agreement, appoint an expert as its representative, the franchisee shall likewise appoint an expert as its representative and the two of them shall appoint a third person, preferably an expert, and the three of them shall constitute a board of arbitration. The board shall report its findings as soon as possible and the rates and charges it shall agree upon by majority vote shall be legal and binding, subject only to review by a court of competent jurisdiction upon application of one of the parties.
\item That the Council shall have the right to require reasonable extensions of any public service system from time to time, and to make such rules and regulations as may be required to secure adequate and proper service and to provide sufficient accommodations for the public.
\item That the grantee shall not issue any capital stock on account of the franchise or the value thereof, and that the grantee shall have no right to receive upon condemnation proceedings brought by the city to acquire the public utility exercising such franchise, any return on account of the franchise or its value.
\item That no sale or lease of the franchise shall be effective until the assignee or lessee shall have filed with the city an instrument, duly executed, reciting the facts of such sale or lease, accepting the terms of the franchise, and agreeing to perform all the conditions required of the grantee thereunder.

\item Every franchise shall contain a provision granting the city the right to acquire the same in accordance with statute.
\item That the franchisee may be obligated by the city to pay the city fees to raise revenue or defray increased costs accruing as a result of utility operations, or both, including, but not limited to, a sum of money based upon gross operating revenues or gross earnings from its operations in the city.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Further Provisions of Franchises}
The enumeration and specification of particular matters which must be included in every franchise or renewal or extension thereof, shall not be construed as impairing the right of the city to insert in any franchise or renewal or extension thereof any further conditions and restrictions as the Council may deem proper to protect the city’s interests, nor shall anything contained in this section limit any right or power possessed by the city over existing franchises.\newline
